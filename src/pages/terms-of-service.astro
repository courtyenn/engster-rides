    fast as possible while still upholding to our standard of quality. Due to certain
    circumstances out of our control shipping times may vary. Delivered but not received:
    If you contacted your shipping provider and they were unable to find your package,
    please contact our customer support team so we can help you further. Tracking:
    Once the order is processed and scanned you will receive an email with your tracking
