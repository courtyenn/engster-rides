          Growing up in Heidenheim, just a short drive from Stuttgart, I was
          undoubtedly destined to become a Porsche enthusiast. As a young boy,
          I'd constantly pester my father to place me in anything with four
          wheels. Whether it was a flashy car on a carnival ride or the red
          self-propelled Bobby-Car, my passion for cars was always there. The
          excitement in me grew as I realized that cars were more than just
          machines; they were a way of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I got older and wiser, the car plastered on my wall was a 1996
          Arena Red Porsche 911 4S. It was in that moment that I knew, without a
          doubt, that I would one day have a Porsche of my own. I'd spend
          countless hours reading every tidbit of information I could find about
          Porsche, getting to know all the models, the optional trims, and the
          horsepower behind each one. I'd daydream about my perfect Porsche,
          imagining it in every color and variation.

          During my teenage years, I'd eagerly admire every Porsche that crossed
          my path. I'd make regular trips to the dealership to check out the
          latest designs, the cutting-edge technology, and the most robust
          engines. One of my best friends in college had a 944, and boy, did he
          make that car sing. Every single day, I yearned for a Porsche, and
          every single day, I'd just sit and drool, whispering to myself, "One
          day, Martin, one day."

          Life took its course, and before I knew it, I was working full-time at
          my machining company, and I became a father. All the extra money I
          once had seemed to disappear. I drove a practical car, always a
          European one, of course, but it made sense for my lifestyle. My
          lifelong dream of owning a Porsche was tucked away, with me thinking
          it was a distant dream.

          A few more years passed, and I finally made a decision. It was time to
          search for my first Porsche. I set my sights on a Macan â€“ the "all in
          one" solution that suited my needs perfectly. But it couldn't just be
          any Macan; it had to be a Turbo. I called about several Porsche Macan
          Turbos, but each time, I struck out. Finally, I came across a listing
          for a black Macan Turbo in NYC, no pictures, just the build sheet and
          mileage. I called immediately, asked for the salesman, and told him,
          "Consider it SOLD." Two weeks later, it was on its way HOME.

          Oh boy, when that beast was delivered to my house, I was like a kid in
          a candy store. I immediately got to work customizing and tweaking it
          in every way possible. After all, Porsche is known for being the most
          customizable car, and that's what makes them so awesome! I changed the
          trim color and skid plate colors, amped up the exhaust, and there was
          no turning back. The Porsche bug had bitten me, and it bit hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          What's even more incredible is that my son caught the Porsche bug too.
          Together, we attended a few Porsche events, met amazing people, and
          that led us to join the Porsche Club of America. Today, I can proudly
          say that we are members, and I'm currently serving as the Vice
          President of the PCA Warbonnets in Oklahoma City, OK. This journey is
          no longer just mine; it's something my son and I share, and it's
          brought us closer together.

          Throughout my life, I'd envisioned and dreamed of my Porsche journey,
          and now, it's all coming to life in ways I never imagined. But the
          story doesn't end there. We've got big plans ahead, and we're
          expanding our passion for cars to the next level. My son and I have
          decided to create apparel that allow others to proudly show their love
          for cars just like we do. We're excited about this new endeavor, and
          we can't wait to see what the future holds for us and our ever-growing
          Porsche family. It's a thrilling journey that we're happy to share
          with the world!
